Edit config.cfg to match your setup. Start steam_wfb.py first and check for initialization and data. Start fpv.sh.
fpv.sh have one pipeline with video only, and one with audio. I will addargument to chose betweeen them later.

Using aggregation and distributor options, compatible with openwrt and remote nodes, as well as local interfaces (add to config.cfg) 

Steam shortcuts:
/bin/konsole
/home/deck/steam_wfb-ng/
--profile steam_wfb -e ./steam_wfb.py

"/home/deck/steam_wfb-ng/fpv.sh"
/home/deck/steam_wfb-ng/
